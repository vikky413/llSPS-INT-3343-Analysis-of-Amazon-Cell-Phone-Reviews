90 percent of the consumers read online reviews before they decide to purchase any Mobile phone from any e-commerce website .Online Mobile applications has revolutionised the way consumers purchase mobile phones online as these apps have all the information regarding any mobile phone at users finger tips. Amazon is one of the best mobile applications which is considered as a treasure trove of all mobile reviews, and their review system is accessible across all channels presenting reviews in an easy-to-use format. So , There should be a system which analyses thousands of reviews of unlocked mobile phones sold on Amazon.com to find insights with respect to reviews, ratings, price and their relationships.

This project aims at building a model to predict the helpfulness of the review and the rating based on the review text. Corpus-based and knowledge-based methods can be used to determine the semantic similarity of review text. We will be using Natural language processing to analyse the sentiment ( positive or a negative) of the given review . A sample web application is integrated to the model built.
